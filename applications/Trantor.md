## Project Overview



### Overview



- **Name:** Trantor
- **Brief Description:** [Trantor](http://https://trantor.xyz/ "Trantor") is a unified Web3 portal promoting interconnectivity among communities and brands through empowered Decentralized Identities (DIDs). 
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Trantor integrates multiple public chains, and EOSIO plays a crucial part in the Web3 world. It is our calling to strive to promote the development of the EOS ecosystem. We would like to contribute to the prosperity of the ecosystem by motivating our user base and community to learn more about EOS and the other projects within the ecosystem.
- **Reason for Interest:** We are attracted by EVM incentives on EOS. We believe that with EOS' high performance and EVM compatibility, Trantor will be a useful tool for projects within the ecosystem and add value to the future development of the ecosystem.


### Ecosystem Fit



- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Trantor adds to the diversity of the applications in the ecosystem. As there is no similar marketing and traffic aggregation platform within the ecosystem, Trantor can act as the portal to the Web3 world for both Web2 and Web3 users. Our users and community will naturally get familiarised with the EOS ecosystem. 
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

From a 2C perspective, we target our own users and the users of other dapps within the ecosystem, where they can experience and learn about various Web3 projects and accumulate their DID data along the way; from a 2B perspective, we target all projects and communities. They can collaborate with us for campaigns and marketing events. 
- What need(s) does your project meet?

Needs for branding and marketing in the Web3 world and the needs for DID data aggregation for both users and projects. As there are no similar projects within the EOS system currently, we are in a unique position to address the needs of EOS users. 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

  There is none in the EOS ecosystem. Glaxe and Quest3 can be considered similar to us. However, we are unique in terms of how we design our interactive quests with support from top notch metaverse projects and how we organise ecosystem carnivals to maximize the co-marketing impact.

## Development Roadmap


### Milestone Summary


- **Total Estimated Duration:** 5 weeks 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 5 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 100,000 USD

We will develop a complete quest system dedicated to the EOS ecosystem, meeting the distinct needs of projects and users. 
Through our MVB (Most Valuable Builder) system, the focus is to motivate new users to learn about the EOS ecosystem and the projects within, existing users to build and preach about the ecosystem. When users get meaningful rewards while they learn and build, the ecosystem will accumulate a large number of loyal users. 
Through our Carnival quest system, projects within the ecosystem can obtain considerable exposure in a short period of time, and with the co-marketing effect, users learn about the core functions and value of these projects while participating in the carnivals.
